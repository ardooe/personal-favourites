## Frameworks

* [Play Framework](https://playframework.com/) :lock: - High Velocity Web Framework. Java and Scala, quite straightforward for RESTful services & web

* [Spark Framework](https://sparkjava.com) :lock: - A micro framework for Java 8. What I like about it is that you get a working web app fast without much configuration.

* [Vert.x](http://vertx.io/) - A tool-kit for building asynchronous, reactive fast applications on the JVM. Easy to grasp, good for microservices.

## Libraries

* [HikariCP](https://brettwooldridge.github.io/HikariCP/) :lock: - Well configurable, fast JDBC connection pool
* [Sql2o](https://www.sql2o.org/) :lock: - Easy, fast SQL to object for Java. You can build your own ORM around this library.
