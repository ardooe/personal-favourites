# Personal Favourites

List of personal favourites (libraries, frameworks, etc.).

## Frameworks & APIs

* [Keras](https://keras.io) - High-level neural networks API for Python. User friendly.
* [Spark Framework](http://sparkjava.com) - A micro framework for Java/Kotlin. What I like about it is that you get a working web app fast without much configuration. I have done multiple APIs in production with this one.

## Libraries

* [Chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) - Terminal styling. I use this when creating command line tools.
* [D3.js](https://d3js.org) - Manipulate documents based on data. DataViz or anything you can think of.
* [HikariCP](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP) - Well configurable, fast JDBC connection pool, I always use this if I need a connection pool for Java-based stuff.
* [Three.js](https://threejs.org) - 3D library for JavaScript. Easy to work with after the initial head scratching. I did some warehouse demoing with this one.

## Tools

* [atillery](https://github.com/artilleryio/artillery) - Performance testing tool for web apps, easy to configure.
* [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) - Version manager for multiple tools and frameworks, Node.js, Java, etc. Highly recommended!
* [Emmet](https://emmet.io) - Toolkit for Web developers, HTML generator. Essential, use it. Built in with VSCode.
