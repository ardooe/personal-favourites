# Personal Favourites

List of personal favourites (libraries, frameworks, etc.).

## Frameworks & APIs

* [Keras](https://keras.io) - High-level neural networks API for Python. Fast experimentation and user friendly, runs on top of TensorFlow, CNTK or Theano.
* [Spark Framework](http://sparkjava.com) - A micro framework for Java/Kotlin. What I like about it is that you get a working web app fast without much configuration. I have done multiple APIs in production with this one.

## Libraries

* [D3.js](https://d3js.org) - Manipulate documents based on data. DataViz or anything you can think of.
* [HikariCP](https://brettwooldridge.github.io/HikariCP/) - Well configurable, fast JDBC connection pool, I always use this if I need a connection pool for Java-based stuff.
* [Sql2o](https://www.sql2o.org/) - Easy, fast SQL to object for Java. You can build your own ORM around this library (not that you should).
* [Three.js](https://threejs.org) - 3D library for JavaScript. Easy to work with after initial head scratching.

## Tools

* [Emmet](https://emmet.io) - Toolkit for Web developers, HTML generator. Essential, use it. Built in with VSCode
* [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) - Node.js Version Manager, can't really live without this.
